// Three projects, because "a frame rendered" is true on *either* graphics backend and so cannot by
// itself prove invariant 5 (WebGPU by default, WebGL2 as the escape hatch). Each project pins down
// one part of the suite:
//
//   chromium — no WebGPU flag, so navigator.gpu is absent and the renderer takes its automatic
//              WebGL2 fallback. Keeps that fallback exercised rather than merely theoretical.
//              Runs against `?kernel=off` (issue #25) — the Phase 1 scene only.
//   webgpu   — --enable-unsafe-webgpu, which is sufficient on its own: Chrome ships a SwiftShader
//              WebGPU backend, so a headless CI runner with no GPU still gets a real adapter — no
//              Vulkan driver install and no GPU runner required. Also runs against `?kernel=off`;
//              which backend gets used is orthogonal to the kernel.
//   kernel   — the kernel-driven parametric scene (issues #25, #26). Its own project because it's
//              the one suite that has to wait on the ~22 MB occt-wasm module compiling on first
//              load, so it gets a much longer default test timeout than the other two — without
//              this, the fast suites above would either inherit that timeout needlessly or the
//              kernel suite would flake under their tighter one.
//
// --enable-gpu is what decides *which* adapter you get. Headless Chromium disables the GPU by
// default and hands back SwiftShader even on a machine with a perfectly good one; with the flag, a
// developer machine resolves to real hardware (metal-3 on Apple silicon) while a GPU-less CI runner
// still degrades to SwiftShader. That is why the hardware-acceleration assertion in webgpu.e2e.ts
// can pass locally and skip on CI rather than being impossible everywhere.
//
// WebGPU requires a secure context; http://localhost:4173 qualifies.
