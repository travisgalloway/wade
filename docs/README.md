# wade — documentation

A CAD PWA: SvelteKit run as a client-side SPA, brepjs/OpenCascade for the geometry kernel, three.js WebGPU for rendering.

## Start here

**Read [`architecture/invariants.md`](./architecture/invariants.md) first.** Nine rules govern this codebase, most are enforced by CI rather than by convention, and the source cites them by number. Nothing else here will make sense without them.

Then, depending on what you are doing:

| If you are…                              | Read                                                                                                                               |

## The doc set

### Architecture — how it works today

- **[invariants.md](./architecture/invariants.md)** — the nine rules, and how each is enforced. Canonical; also GitHub issue #1.
- **[threading-model.md](./architecture/threading-model.md)** — main thread / kernel worker / render context, and the one-way data flow between them. The spine.
- **[kernel.md](./architecture/kernel.md)** — `KernelClient`, the wire contract, debounce and conflation, and the honest cancellation guarantee.
- **[rendering.md](./architecture/rendering.md)** — on-demand rendering, WebGPU with a WebGL2 fallback, TSL-only shading, and the `window.__wade` observability contract.
- **[orientation.md](./architecture/orientation.md)** — right-handed Z-up. World space _is_ kernel space.
- **[input.md](./architecture/input.md)** — router → arbiter → picking → snapping, and the precision model behind it.
- **[state-and-errors.md](./architecture/state-and-errors.md)** — document model / GPU / view models, and how kernel failures surface.

### Roadmap — what is built and what is next

- **[phases.md](./roadmap/phases.md)** — status. Phases 0–2 done, **Phase 3 next**.
- **[phase-3-pwa.md](./roadmap/phase-3-pwa.md)** — installable, offline, lazy kernel.
- **[phase-4-cad-depth.md](./roadmap/phase-4-cad-depth.md)** — sketches, constraints, booleans, STEP, feature tree.

### Guides

- **[testing.md](./guides/testing.md)** — the Node-only Vitest project, the five Playwright projects, `window.__wade`.
- **[conventions.md](./guides/conventions.md)** — commits, dependencies, and the config you must not "simplify".

### [risks.md](./risks.md)

Deferred decisions (threaded OCCT, OffscreenCanvas) and open risks (brepjs maturity, WebGPU maturity, the touch precision ceiling, the WASM payload).
